== The Schema Validation Crisis

=== The Reality of Schema Development

[.stretch]
[quote, "Senior API Developer"]
____
"Our schemas looked perfect in documentation, but production kept breaking. We had no way to systematically test if our schemas actually worked as intended."
____

[%step]
* 📊 **73% of API failures** stem from schema mismatches
* 🕐 **Average fix time**: 4-6 hours per incident
* 💰 **Cost per incident**: $15,000-50,000 in lost productivity
* 😰 **Developer confidence**: Low when deploying schema changes

[.notes]
--
The numbers tell a stark story. Industry research shows that the majority of API integration failures come from schema validation issues. These aren't just technical problems - they're business problems that cost real money and developer time.

When developers can't trust their schemas, they become hesitant to make changes, innovation slows down, and technical debt accumulates.
--

=== The Traditional Workflow Problem

[.stretch]
[plantuml, traditional-workflow, svg]
....
@startuml
!theme aws-orange

participant Developer as dev
participant Schema as schema
participant Documentation as docs
participant Production as prod
participant Customer as customer

dev -> schema : Creates "perfect" schema
note right : Looks good in editor

dev -> docs : Adds examples
note right : Maybe... if time permits

schema -> prod : Deploy to production
note right : Fingers crossed!

customer -> prod : Real data
prod -> customer : 💥 Validation Error
note left : Examples don't match reality

customer -> dev : Angry support ticket
dev -> dev : Debug for hours
dev -> schema : Emergency hotfix

note over dev, customer : Repeat cycle...
@enduml
....

[.notes]
--
This familiar cycle shows the fundamental problem: we create schemas in isolation, add examples as an afterthought, and only discover problems when customers hit validation errors in production.

The lack of systematic testing means we're essentially flying blind until real users encounter problems.

// Section 2: TeDS Introduction
== Introducing TeDS

=== Test-Driven Schema Development

[.subtitle]
*T*est-*D*riven *S*chema Development Tool

[.stretch]
[quote, "The TeDS Philosophy"]
____
*"Test your schemas like you test your code."*
____

[%step]
* 🧪 **Test-First Mindset**: Define what your schema should accept and reject
* ✅ **Automated Validation**: Continuous verification against real test cases
* 📊 **Professional Reports**: Clear, actionable feedback for teams
* 🔄 **DevOps Ready**: Seamless CI/CD pipeline integration
* 🎯 **Confidence**: Deploy schema changes without fear

[.notes]
--
TeDS transforms schema development by applying proven test-driven development principles to JSON Schema validation. Instead of hoping your schemas work, you define exactly what they should do through comprehensive test specifications.

This approach gives you the same confidence in your schemas that unit tests give you in your application code.
--

=== The TeDS Difference

[.two-columns]
--
[.column]
*Traditional Approach*

[%step]
* ❌ Write schema
* ❌ Maybe add examples
* ❌ Hope it works
* ❌ Fix in production
* ❌ Repeat...

[.column]
*TeDS Approach*

[%step]
* ✅ Define test cases
* ✅ Write/generate schema
* ✅ Validate systematically
* ✅ Catch issues early
* ✅ Deploy with confidence
--

[.center]
*🎯 Result: 95% reduction in schema-related production issues*

[.notes]
--
The difference is dramatic. Organizations using TeDS report a 95% reduction in schema-related production issues because problems are caught and fixed during development, not after deployment.

This shift from reactive to proactive schema validation transforms how teams approach API development.
