# TeDS Web-App Concept

## Project Overview

A locally-running web application for executing and validating TeDS test specifications with integrated schema display and result visualization. The app operates directly on the local file system without requiring file uploads or downloads.

## Core Architecture

### [ ] 1. Local Development Server
- [ ] Built-in HTTP server that starts with the application
- [ ] Default root directory: current working directory
- [ ] Directory picker for alternative root directory selection
- [ ] File system watching for automatic reload on changes
- [ ] CORS handling for local file access
- [ ] Static file serving for schemas and test specifications

### [ ] 2. Direct File System Operations
- [ ] Read test specifications directly from local directories
- [ ] Write modified test specs back to file system
- [ ] Real-time file watching and auto-refresh
- [ ] Directory tree navigation in the UI
- [ ] No file upload/download required
- [ ] Preserve file permissions and metadata

## Core Functions

### [ ] 3. Test Specification Management
- [ ] Browse local YAML test specifications via file tree
- [ ] In-place editing with direct file system writes
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for YAML content
- [ ] Validation of testspec structure before execution

- [ ] File history and backup creation

### [ ] 4. Schema Integration and Display
- [ ] Automatic extraction of schema references from testspecs
- [ ] Local schema file resolution via relative/absolute paths
- [ ] Remote schema loading over HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- [ ] JSON-Pointer navigation in schemas (`#/components/schemas/User`)
- [ ] Split-pane display: testspec left, schema right
- [ ] Schema viewer with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Clickable references between testspec and schema parts

### [ ] 5. Validation Engine
- [ ] Client-side JSON Schema validation (jsonschema-js)
- [ ] Execute all test cases of a specification
- [ ] Batch processing of multiple testspecs
- [ ] Real-time validation on testspec changes
- [ ] Detailed error reporting
- [ ] Performance metrics (execution time, test count)

### [ ] 6. Result Visualization
- [ ] Test runner dashboard with overview
- [ ] Color-coded result display (green/red/yellow)
- [ ] Detail view for failed tests
- [ ] JSON diff display for validation errors
- [ ] Exportable HTML reports to local file system
- [ ] Timeline view for test execution history
