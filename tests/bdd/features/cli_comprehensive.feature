Feature: TeDS CLI Comprehensive Testing
  As a developer using TeDS
  I want to use all CLI commands effectively
  So that I can verify schemas and generate test specifications

  Background:
    Given I have a temporary workspace

  # === VERIFY COMMAND SCENARIOS ===

  Scenario: Verify with warning output level shows format divergence
    Given I have a schema file "schema.yaml" with content:
      """
      components:

      """
    When I run teds verify "spec.yaml" with output level "warning"
    Then the command should exit with code 1
    And the output should contain YAML content

  Scenario: CLI reports missing schema file error

  # === VERSIONING SCENARIOS ===

  Scenario: Version command shows tool and spec version information

      tests:

  # === ERROR HANDLING SCENARIOS ===

  Scenario: Invalid YAML syntax is properly reported
    Given I have a file "bad.yaml" with content:
      """
      invalid: yaml: syntax here

  # === GENERATED FILE VALIDATION SCENARIOS ===

  Scenario: Generated files are validatable
